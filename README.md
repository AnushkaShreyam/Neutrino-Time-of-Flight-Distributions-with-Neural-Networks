## Modeling Neutrino Time-of-Flight Distributions with Neural Networks

This project explores the application of neural networks to predict and analyze neutrino time-of-flight (TOF) distributions, contributing to the study of particle behavior in High-Energy Physics (HEP). By employing machine learning techniques, the project aims to uncover insights into TOF distributions with high precision, leveraging experimental datasets and advanced computational tools.
